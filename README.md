**Welcome to the town-crier project!**

**Want to help? There's lots to make better!**  
**Here's a list of things**

- <marquee>The scrolling effect is achieved with a marquee... maybe change that to something modern</marquee>  
- Live updates
- Different sources (instagram, etc)
- The Python-Twitter API will cut off tweets with an ellipsis, make it not do that
- It is not aesthetically pleasing
