***Ver 1.0*** "I don't like it yet"  

**Here is the bad stuff about it:**
- Can't get stuff from school website.  
- Doesn't get full text from a tweet.  
- If a tweet doesn't link to an image, it makes the tweet's text go onto the slideshow all by itself. This can look stupid.  

**Here is what it does:**  
- Gets tweets, puts them into an html document.  
  
<hr>  
  
***Ver 1.1*** "I can get used to it"  
  
**Here is what's changed:**  
- Gets full stuff from school website... I think. It should at least get the relative links to images.  
  
<hr>  

***Ver 1.it.actually.works*** "I've been prematurely naming these, this is the first one that works"  
  
**Here is what doesn't work:**  
- Display will freeze after fullscreen, unfreezes after moving the mouse  
  
<hr>  
  
***Ver 1.I.like.this.nomenclature.better*** "I think it's better"  
  
**Here is what has been fixed/added**  
- Shuts down after  
- No longer freezes  
  
**Here is what needs to be changed**  
- Make it easier to contribute to without using the Twitter API
