# Dev Tools  
  
**Right now I don't have a lot in here, but here's a list.**  
  
- **Phony-Twitter-Scrape.py**  
Puts fake tweets into `html/from-twitter.html`.You may have to create an empty file
named `html/from-school.html` to get it to work with `py/Assemble.py`, ~~but it is fine
to just test `html/twitter-skeleton` by looking at `html/from-twitter`~~. It isn't fine
because `html/from-twitter` doesn't have the css.
